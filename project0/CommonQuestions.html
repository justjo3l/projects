    <p class="Question">What is EDM?</p>
    <img src="https://edm-ghost-production.com/wp-content/themes/edm/images/originaltrack.jpg">
    <p class="Answer">EDM simply stands for <span id="ToBold">Electronic Dance Music</span>. It is the music genre that involves man-made synthesizers and softwares. It is also often called Dance Music or Club Music because it's the kind of music that's usually played in festivals, clubs and other party-like events.</p>
    <p class="Question">How is EDM different from other genres?</p>
    <p class="Answer">EDM is the music genre with the <span id="ToBold">most sub-genres</span>. It has over 160 subgenres and is still increasing. It involves creative thinking of the artists and producers. The specialty of EDM is often thought to be the <span id="ToBold">eye to detail and perfection</span> of the songs they make. It also does not require a natural skill in singing, but rather just requires a love for music and creativity.</p>
    <p class="Question">Is EDM considered real music?</p>
    <p class="Answer">Often audiences think that EDM requires <span id="ToBold">little to no effort or creativity</span> and hence cannot be considered music. To be honest, <span id="ToBold">This could not be any further from the truth</span>. A simple EDM song goes through various different stages before it is completed. Some such stages are Melody-Making, Mixing, Mastering and many more. The entire process of making these songs can range from <span id="ToBold">a week or two to a year or two</span>. It is also worth noting that a person who makes EDM music is mostly also part Audio Engineer. EDM is the musical genre that truly shows the link between electronics and music because EDM Artists/Producers not only <span id="ToBold">come up with a melody</span> but also <span id="ToBold">make the entire song</span>, from the tiniest notes to the biggest synthesizers, all by themselves.</p>
